# Two Sum Problem

## Problem Statement
Given an array of integers and a target value, find two distinct indices
such that their values add up to the target.

## Approach
- Traverse the array once
- Use a hash map to store values and indices
- For each element, check if the complement exists

## Complexity Analysis
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(n)

## Why This Approach
This solution optimizes the brute-force O(n²) approach using hashing,
making it suitable for large inputs.

## Language Used
C++
